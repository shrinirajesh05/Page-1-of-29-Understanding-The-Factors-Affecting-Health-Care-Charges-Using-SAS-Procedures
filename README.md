# Understanding The Factors Affecting Health Care Charges Using SAS Procedures

Overview:

This project investigates the clinical and demographic factors influencing healthcare costs in the United States, with the aim of improving health insurance pricing models and reducing overall medical expenses. By examining variables such as age, BMI, number of children covered, smoking status, gender, and region, this study aims to provide valuable insights into how these factors contribute to health insurance charges.

Data:

Dataset: Health insurance beneficiaries dataset
Sample Size: 1,338 individuals
Variables:
Age
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Number of children covered under the insurance plan
Smoking status
Gender
Region
Medical charges (dependent variable)

Objectives:
The main objectives of the study are:

Identify Clinical Factors: Determine which clinical and demographic factors significantly contribute to variations in health insurance charges.
Regional Analysis: Explore differences in healthcare charges across various regions.
Group Comparisons: Investigate significant cost differences between:
Smokers and non-smokers.
Different age groups.
Individuals with varying numbers of children covered.
Male and female beneficiaries.

Key Findings:
Significant Factors: Age, BMI, number of children covered, smoking status, gender, and region all significantly impact health insurance charges.
Smokers vs. Non-smokers: Smoking status was found to be a major factor driving up healthcare costs.
Age and BMI: Older individuals and those with a higher BMI tend to incur higher medical charges.
Children Coverage: The number of children covered also plays a role in determining healthcare costs.
These insights can aid insurance companies and healthcare providers in developing more accurate and fair pricing models, as well as creating targeted interventions to manage these factors and reduce costs for patients and clients.

Applications:
Insurance Pricing Models: Insurance companies can use these findings to adjust premiums based on risk factors and offer more tailored plans.
Healthcare Providers: Providers can develop strategies and preventive measures to reduce healthcare costs by addressing high-risk factors such as smoking and obesity.
Policy Implications: Policymakers can leverage this data to introduce initiatives that promote healthier lifestyles and preventive care to reduce healthcare expenses.

Future Work:
Further studies could include more variables, such as pre-existing medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic status, to refine the understanding of how different elements contribute to healthcare costs. Additionally, exploring longitudinal data could provide insights into how healthcare costs evolve over time based on changes in these factors.
